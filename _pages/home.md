## About Me & Research Focus

I am a PhD student in Computational and Applied Mathematics with research interests in the numerical analysis of partial differential equations, finite element methods, and mixed-dimensional modeling. My work focuses on developing, analyzing, and implementing stable and convergent schemes for coupled 3D–1D PDE systems, with applications in porous media and network flow problems.

## Current Research Project

**Coupled 3D–1D Advection-Diffusion PDEs**  
I am currently working on a project that couples three-dimensional and one-dimensional advection-diffusion equations to model flows in porous media and networked structures. The focus is on creating stable numerical schemes and analyzing their convergence properties.

## Research Methods & Interests

- Numerical analysis of partial differential equations (PDEs)  
- Finite Element Methods (FEM)  
- Discontinuous Galerkin Methods  
- Mixed-dimensional modeling (3D–1D coupling)  
- Applications in porous media and network flows

## Beyond Research

Outside of research, I enjoy reading, music, personal development, and engaging in faith-based and community activities. I value balance and believe creativity outside mathematics strengthens my academic work.
